ruby CHANGELOG
==============

0.2.0
-----
- [jpcallanta] - Checks if existing version of ruby is installed instead of checking the existence of the installer shell script.
- Added cleanup of installer script, source directory, and source tarball. 

0.1.0
-----
- [jpcallanta] - Initial release of ruby. No tests, functionally install system ruby to target node but no removal or proper check if system ruby is already installed.
